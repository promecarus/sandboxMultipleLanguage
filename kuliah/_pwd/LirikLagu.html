				We're no strangers to love<br />
				You know the rules and so do I<br />
				A full commitment's what I'm thinking of <br />
				You wouldn't get this from any other guy <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br />
				Gotta make you understand<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Never gonna give you up <br />
				Never gonna let you down<br />
				Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
				Never gonna make you cry <br />
				Never gonna say goodbye <br />
				Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				We've known each other for so long <br />
				Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it <br />
				Inside we both know what's been going on <br />
				We know the game and we're gonna play it <br />
				And if you ask me how I'm feeling <br />
				Don't tell me you're too blind to see <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Never gonna give you up <br />
				Never gonna let you down <br />
				Never gonna run around and desert you <br />
				Never gonna make you cry <br />
				Never gonna say goodbye <br />
				Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Never gonna give you up <br />
				Never gonna let you down <br />
				Never gonna run around and desert you <br />
				Never gonna make you cry <br />
				Never gonna say goodbye <br />
				Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Never gonna give, never gonna give <br />
				(Give you up) <br />
			</p>

				Hello, it's me <br />
				I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
				<br />
				To go over everything <br />
				They say that time's supposed to heal ya <br />
				But I ain't done much healing <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello, can you hear me? <br />
				I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be <br />
				When we were younger and free <br />
				I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				There's such a difference between us <br />
				And a million miles <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello from the other side <br />
				I must've called a thousand times <br />
				To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br />
				But when I call, you never seem to be home <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello from the outside <br />
				At least I can say that I've tried <br />
				To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br />
				But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello, how are you? <br />
				It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry <br />
				I hope that you're well <br />
				Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever
				happened?
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				So hello from the other side (Other side) <br />
				I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) <br />
				To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br />
				But when I call, you never seem to be home <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello from the outside (Outside) <br />
				At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) <br />
				To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br />
				But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Ooh-ooh, anymore <br />
				Ooh-ooh-ooh, anymore <br />
				Ooh-ooh, anymore <br />
				Anymore <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello from the other side (Other side) <br />
				I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) <br />
